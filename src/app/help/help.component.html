<p>To begin playing, go to the dashboard and select whether you want to be Pirates or Wizards. If someone else is playing and has already selected one, you will have to be the other.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Once the game starts, you will draw 3 cards from your deck to your hand (with a maximum of 5 cards in the hand at a time). Play these in lanes by selecting a card, then selecting which lane to play it in. Keep in mind whether you're trying to destroy the enemy mothership or the enemy's cards. Playing in lanes they don't have cards in is a quick way to destroy their mothership.</p>
<br><br>
<p>After playing your cards into your lanes, hit "End Turn" and your cards will perform their attacks, then it will be your enemy's turn!</p>

<h2>Good luck, have fun</h2>
